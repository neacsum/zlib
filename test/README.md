- `lorem1.txt` and `lorem2.txt` are plaintext files generated with a [lorem generator](https://www.lipsum.com/).
- `lorem1.gz` and `lorem2.gz` are their counterparts compressed with gzip 1.6

Additionally:
- `lorem12.txt` is a concatenation of `lorem1.txt` and `lorem2.txt`.
- `lorem12.gz` is the compressed content of `lorem12.txt`.
  
They can be used to test the `gzappend` and `gzjoin` examples.
